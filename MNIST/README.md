Builing a convolutional Neural Net In order to impliment MNIST classification, and exporting it to ONNX.

MNIST.py documented at https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist

More details of MNIST at this link: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The MNIST.py program will train a model, and after training, the Inference.py program will export it to a ONNX capable of being executed with barracuda.
