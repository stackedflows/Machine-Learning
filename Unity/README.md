# MNIST in Unity

In order to execute the MNIST model with Unity, two C# scripts must be run in unity:

    relevant files are: Worker.cs
                        Inference.cs

Inference .cs will communicate with the frontend unity UI and process the data so that the barracuda engine can handle inference in worker.cs.

These are documented best here: https://github.com/MarekMarchlewicz/AI-Drawing


# Making a basic Chat Bot
    
    relevant files are OSCOVA.cs

The oscova framework can be explored with unity using this resource https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5267100/Integrating-a-Chatbot-into-Unity-in-Csharp

We can generalise the type of bot in use with the ORYZER platform https://oryzer.com/, which allows easy creation of dialogue structures.
