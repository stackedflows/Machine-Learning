# Chat-Bot in Unity
    
    relevant files are OSCOVA.cs

The oscova framework can be explored with unity using this resource https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5267100/Integrating-a-Chatbot-into-Unity-in-Csharp

We can generalise the type of bot in use with the ORYZER platform https://oryzer.com/, which allows easy creation of dialogue structures.
