# Training-Machine-Learning-Agent

Using PyTorch to build machine learning behaviours in unity, through a virtual environment.

A machine learning program: training a ball to go over a ramp and hit a target.

The learning session outputs an ONNX file that can be re-installed to build further models on top of it.

This model is very heavy, and the framework is not optimised at all.

I will learn to make my own Models with PyTorch, and then design a 2D game around it.
